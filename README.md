# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

command used to create this boiler code 
npm create-react-app telsa-clone --template redux 


--> Install ES7 + React/Redux, what this will do is if we go to any of the created component file, just type rfce, it will give us a   boiler code

Example: 
import React from 'react'

function Header() {
  return (
    <div>Header</div>
  )
}

export default Header


--> Included styled components 
command: npm add styled-components
